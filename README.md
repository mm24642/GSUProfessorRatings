GSU Professor Ratings is a Google Chrome extension designed to display student professor ratings from [ratemyprofessors.com](https://www.ratemyprofessors.com/) into the publicly available [course listings](https://coursesearch.georgiasouthern.edu/) for Georgia Southern University. The extension also features a popup options menu to enable/disable rating display, and each rating provides a link to the professor's respective rating page. 

GSU Professor Ratings utilizes only vanilla JavaScript, HTML5, and CSS3. API responses are stored locally and served to the user when the professor's name is loaded on the course listings.

## üöÄ Installation and Usage

GSU Professor Ratings is available for download on the [Google Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/gsu-professor-rating/bmjjdglakapobkkaclbdoehoflhnjdhk). Ratings can be viewed simply by searching for courses on the official Georgia Southern course listings.
